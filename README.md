• Developed a real-time route optimization system aimed at reducing emergency response time by generating the fastest possible paths using live traffic and road data.
• Utilized advanced technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GPS/Geolocation, Map/Traffic APIs, and Dijkstra/A* routing algorithms to build a reliable and dynamic navigation platform.
• Achieved smoother and more accurate emergency navigation through live map rendering, automatic path updates, smart alerts, and robust error handling.
